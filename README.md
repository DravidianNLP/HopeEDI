HopeEDI: A Multilingual Hope Speech Detection Dataset for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion

Abstract
Over the past few years, systems have been developed to control online content and eliminate abusive, offensive or hate speech content. 
However, people in power sometimes misuse this form of censorship to obstruct the democratic right of freedom of speech. 
Therefore, it is imperative that research should take a positive reinforcement approach towards online content that is encouraging, positive and supportive contents. Until now, most studies have focused on solving this problem of negativity in the English language, though the problem is much more than just harmful content. Furthermore, it is multilingual as well. Thus, we have constructed a Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (HopeEDI) containing user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with 28,451, 20,198 and 10,705 comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as containing hope speech or not. To our knowledge, this is the first research of its kind to annotate hope speech for equality, diversity and inclusion in a multilingual setting. We determined that the inter-annotator agreement of our dataset using Krippendorffâ€™s alpha. Further, we created several baselines to benchmark the resulting dataset and the results have been expressed using precision, recall and F1-score. The dataset is publicly available for the research community. 
We hope that this resource will spur further research on encouraging inclusive and responsive speech that reinforces positiveness.

Hope speech reflects the belief that one can discover pathways to their desired objectives and become roused to utilise those pathways. To encourage research in natural language processing towards positive reinforcement approach, we created a hope speech detection dataset. This paper reports on the shared task of hope speech detection for Tamil, English, and Malayalam languages. The shared task was conducted as a part of the EACL 2021 workshop on Language Technology for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (LT-EDI-2021). We summarize here the datasets for this challenge which are openly available at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/27653, and present an overview of the methods and the results of the competing systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared task to conduct hope speech detection.",
